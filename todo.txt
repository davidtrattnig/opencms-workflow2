Possible Improvements:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Project deletion - workflow stages inconsistent (current solution:
  deleting the workflow stage before deleting a project). 
  
* UI Improvement: New stage dialog - stage dropdown should show more
  convenient textual information like "Insert before project xxx", 
  "Insert after project xxx".
  
* UI Improvement: taskview extension.

* Add/check localization support for multiple languages

* Create separate context menu entries for approve/reject

* Multi-Selection of resources

* Workflow doesn't work for folders

* Approve/Reject dialog: Improve confirmation question
  
* Merge both message.properties to the one with module package name.

* Additional workflow configuration dialog inside the OpenCms administration
  panel.
  
* Check task titles configuration

* Move default project id to config class

* Review exception handling if an transition is not available

* Review reject action - approve transition taken??

* Message if context menu is deactivated / resource belongs to antother project

* Review publish online handling

* insert date presentation rules?
