Possible Improvements:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Project deletion - workflow stages inconsistent (current solution:
  deleting the workflow stage before deleting a project)
  
* UI Improvement: New stage dialog - stage dropdown should show more
  convenient textual information like "Insert before project xxx", 
  "Insert after project xxx".
  
* UI Improvement: taskview extension.

* Add/check localization support for multiple languages

* Create separate context menu entries for approve/reject

* Multi-Selection of resources

* Workflow doesn't work for folders

* Approve/Reject dialog: Improve confirmation question

* Review behaviour when resource is locked and a "move to project"
  is performed.
  
* Merge both message.properties to the one with module package name.

* Additional workflow configuration dialog inside the OpenCms administration
  panel.
